A collection of beautiful places to run. 
Create a list of favorite runs, your bucket list with must-do runs and inspire people to keep running.
Running is great, running is fun; stay motivated by finding new places to run and sharing your nice finds with other people.

## History

I love running and I love coding. I started this as a side project when I by chance ran in to [Runner's world's Rave Runs](http://www.runnersworld.com/rave-run/rave-runs-beautiful-places-to-run)
Originally I built out a site with Runner's world's runs as some sort of "bucket list" but realized it could be nice if people could add their own lists. 

## Contributing

Currently the app is Open-Source, is it's still a side project for me, I can not guarantee it'll always stay that way.
Feel free to contribute as long as it's Open Source.

The app is built with Angular 2 and Angular 2 CLI. Look up the documentation on running the project locally.
